            <h2>Human Genetics</h2>
            <p>Human genetics is the study of inheritance as it occurs in human beings. It includes the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity in humans.</p>
            <h3>DNA and Genes</h3>
            <p>DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that carries genetic information. Genes are segments of DNA that code for proteins, which perform various functions in the body.</p>
            <h3>Genetic Variation</h3>
            <p>Genetic variation refers to differences in DNA sequences among individuals. These variations can influence traits such as eye color, height, and susceptibility to diseases.</p>
            <h3>Inheritance Patterns</h3>
            <p>Inheritance patterns describe how genetic traits are passed from parents to offspring. Common patterns include autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked inheritance.</p>
            <h3>Genetic Disorders</h3>
            <p>Genetic disorders are caused by mutations in genes. Examples include cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and Huntington's disease. Advances in genetic research are leading to new treatments and therapies.</p>
